## Express-Session morning review
Wednesday, October 17

This review will serve as a simple application utilizing Express-session, redux, and routing. 

- Packages are already installed, just run npm i. (express, express-session, redux, react-redux, react-router-dom, axios, body-parser, dotenv)
- Set up route page. Import into App.js.
- Set up redux store ( Make sure to wrap the app with the provider ).
- Connect redux to Page 2. Create input field.
- Set up index.js in server. Bring in session. (Don't forget about .env)

- Add links ( if time permit )
